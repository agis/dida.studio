          in the Hotel, Retail & Residence sector. The big growth of architects,
          from 53 to 100+ in 2023, challenged her abilities to create
          co-operative methods of directing and leading the projects.

          Aristotles University of Thessaloniki in Greece, in the BA of Interior
