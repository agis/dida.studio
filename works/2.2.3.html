        House in Vari is a 2 storey house with mezzanine, in the seaside region
        of Vari, in Southeastern Athens. The proposal suggests a pool divided
        house with a composition of indoor and outdoor spaces, in order to
        create an introvert house model that multiplies the space within its
        shell.

      <div class="text2">
        The brief consists of a ground floor with a living area, main kitchen
        and the 2 bedrooms of the couple and their child, as the mezzanine gives
        room to an office space and a guest room.
      </div>
      <div class="text3">
        The rooftop is conceived to be a space of outdoor uses, such as yoga
        practice area and dining area with a view, alongside with the necessity
        of the solar panels, that covers 50% of the house energy consumption,
        classified as A+.
      </div>
      <div class="text4">
        Although the total coverage is nearly 245m2 and the total Built Area is
        225m2, the house volume is stretched to the limits. The pool was a brief
        millestone, as the routine of the couple covers swimming for a 20 minute
        set.
