2.2.3		House in Vari		CT x USP (Courtecy of USP)	New Built		2021


House in Vari is a 2 storey house with mezzanine, in the seaside region of Vari, in Southeastern Athens. The proposal suggests a pool divided house with a composition of indoor and outdoor spaces, in order to create an introvert house model that multiplies the space within its shell.

The brief consists of a ground floor with a living area, main kitchen and the 2 bedrooms of the couple and their child, as the mezzanine gives room to an office space and a guest room.

The rooftop is conceived to be a space of outdoor uses, such as yoga practice area and dining area with a view, alongside with the necessity of the solar panels, that covers 50% of the house energy consumption, classified as A+.

Although the total coverage is nearly 245m2 and the total Built Area is 225m2, the house volume is stretched to the limits. The pool was a brief millestone, as the routine of the couple covers swimming for a 20 minute set.
