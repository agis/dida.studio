2.2.6		Multiresidence in Chalandri	CT x USP (Courtecy of USP)		 Facade design	2020


Multiresidence in Chalandri is a multi-storey residential building (5 levels) providing different types of living models, such as two-storey top suites, one storey apartments in different sizes, and mezonette apartments with private pool in the private garden area.

The ground floor is used as Pilotis, for parking area.

The proposal suggests a horizontal arrangement with slimed slabs, roundish shaped columes placed in different angles, cubic oversized sandstone greenery and glass railings for unmeditated view.

The use of black metal window frames contrasts with the off-white wall colours and the sandy look of the outdoor area.
