2.2.2		EAS Paros		CT x USP (Courtecy of USP)	Masterplan	2022


EAS Paros is a Union of Agricultural Cooperatives settled 650m from the coastal line of Paroikia, in Paros Aegean Island, founded in 1929, including a Winery, a Dairy Fram, an oil Mill, a Barn, a Compost area with a Greenhouse and the Union’ s Office space.

The proposal suggests a specific visitor’s route, a specific designed pathway through the Masterplan’s already built environment, and the incorporation of the existing facades of the Winery.

In this very large plot that reaches nearly 35.000 sqm, and the total built area 6000sqm, the proposition sets a system of Folies (points of interest) that activates the total plot.

Moreover an experimental vineyard/ open museum, parking areas for the daylight usage of the space, services track roads and a slope made from “xerolithies” accommodates some of the rest events of the Union.
